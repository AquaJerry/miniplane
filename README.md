## Intro
In the past several weeks, a GitHub repo named [wechat_jump_game](https://github.com/wangshub/wechat_jump_game) has won thousands of stars. What's the magic?

Now let's look into our daily social life, what would you do if you don't want to talk to anyone on your contact? One way to "keep in touch" is to play such a really simple, easy and even a little boring game.

This repo is a clone of WeChat official demo.

## Usage
You should have [npmjs](https://npmjs.com) installed before.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/aquajerry/miniplane.git
cd miniplane
npm start
```
